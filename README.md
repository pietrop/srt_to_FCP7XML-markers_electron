# `srt_to_FCP7XML-markers_electron` 

An electron mac os x desktop app to open an srt, subtitle file, and creates a sequence of markers with that text, that can be open in Adobe Premiere (FCP7 XML). App wraps around [srt_to_FCP7XML-markers](https://github.com/pietrop/srt_to_FCP7XML-markers) node module.

## Disclaimer 

This is a quick hack work in progress, mainly to test out if it was technically possible, learn more about adding marker and manipulating FCP7 XML sequences programmatically as well as whether there is any interest in the project.
